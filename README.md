## What we are trying to build
We will be build a MCP setup that can query over 200+ different sources — all from a single chat interface — using:

1. mcp-use (a handy tool from YC S25) for the local MCP client.
2. MindsDB for hooking into all those data sources.
3. Ollama to run open-source LLMs locally.
